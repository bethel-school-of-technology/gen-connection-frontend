                    The story behind this website is that of wanting to preserve the collective wisdom of each 
                    generation.  I was watching a documentary about the World War 2 generation that is slowing 
                    passing away and I thought wow, so is their collective wisdom!  So I started researching 
                    and found that there were literally no sites that allow us to pass on specific wisdom that is 
                    cataloged in one place for each generation.  Everyone has a story and as I walk through life and meet
                    so many different people of every background, I'm inspired and in awe of how wonderful we all are.  So as 
                    I participate in this thing called life I get to be an admirer of all of you in your own unique journey as
                    we walk this road together!  I hope that you see the beautiful stories in these pages and that it makes
                    you want to be a better person which in turn makes the world a better place because of you!
