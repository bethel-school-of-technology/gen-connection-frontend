        <h1>Welcome to Generation X</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Generation X is the cohort between the Baby Boomer Generation and the Millennials Generation. We were born
          between 1965 and 1980, although some say it could be as early as 1960 and as late as 1985. Why are we called
          the X generation?
          The term was first used in an article to note how this generation seemed lost and not seen. Generation X
          numbers vary
          depending on what time span you use, but its estimated between 56-62 million, while Baby Boomers and
          Millennials
          each have an estimated 72-75 million. Gen X is sometimes referred to as the "latchkey generation" as we were
          often
          left unsupervised at home after school until our parents came home from work. This generation also has an
          unprecented
          situation in which we are supporting and educating our own children while simultaneously providing care for
          our aging
          parents.
          <!-- We are patient and steadfast in our priorities and once we make a decision, we tend to stick with it! The good news is that we are a generation that knows how to be by ourselves and are completely content with
          waiting.  -->
